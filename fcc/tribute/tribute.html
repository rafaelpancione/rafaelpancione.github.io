        <p id="tribute-info">Anthony Frank Hawk (born May 12, 1968), nicknamed Birdman, is an American professional
            skateboarder,
            entrepreneur, and the owner of the skateboard company Birdhouse. He completed the first documented "900"
            skateboarding trick in 1999, licensed a video game series named after him published by Activision that same
            year, and is a pioneer of modern vertical skateboarding. He retired from competing professionally in
            2003 and is regarded as one of the most influential skateboarders of all time.

            Hawk has been involved in various philanthropic activities throughout his career, and is the founder of the
            Tony Hawk Foundation, which helps to build skateparks in underprivileged areas around the world.</p>
